In this task I had used VPN to Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.For this task I had used ProtonVPN free tier.I had downloaded the Proton VPN free tier client and started it 
after that I got the IP address of United states and I checked my IP address through "whatismyipaddress.com" which was same as on the proton VPN app which I had uploaded on this repository as vpn_1 and vpn_2.After
that,I had disconnected the VPN then checked my Ip address then it showed my orignal IP address which I had uploaded named as vpn_3.After that I had researched about VPN Encryption and privacy features which uses:-
Strong encryption: Most use AES-256-bit encryption, ensuring your data is secure.
Privacy protection: No-log policies, DNS/WebRTC/IPv6 leak protection, kill switches.
Session security: Some offer "forward secrecy", generating unique keys per session.
Mitigation of attacks: Multi-factor authentication and secure server infrastructure.
Obfuscation: Some VPNs offer protocols (Stealth, Double VPN) to bypass censorship or VPN blocks.

Benefits of VPN
Privacy & anonymity: Masks IP/location and encrypts online activity; prevents tracking.
Security: Protects against eavesdropping on public WiFi and other insecure connections.
Access: Enables bypassing of geo-restricted content and websites.
Safe remote work: Secures sensitive data transmission for remote employees.

Limitations of VPN
Reduced speed: Encryption and rerouting can decrease browsing/upload/download speeds.
Data/server/device limits: Most free VPNs restrict data usage or available servers.
Trust and security concerns: Must trust provider not to log or misuse data; weak encryption risks exposure.
Compatibility: Some apps or sites block VPN traffic or require complex configuration.
Legal issues: VPN use may be restricted or illegal in some countries.

Summary- Free VPNs like ProtonVPN or PrivadoVPN provide robust privacy and reasonable usability limits. They’re excellent for basic privacy protection, WiFi safety, and bypassing content blocks—but
expect slower speeds and occasional usage limits. Always choose a provider with strong encryption, no logs, and have reasonable expectations about speed and access.
